Install Linux (Ubuntu, Linux-Mint or Majaro) and Linux applications on a brand new top PC

Developing hardware is no longer starting from an idea on a napkin and working on bits of paper but requires a decent PC to mimic that first idea written on a napkin and then worked out onm lots of paper. DUring my career I've wrestled with the process of going from paper to digital and wrestled with all kind of PC related issues and flaws. Finally developed a method of working but always had issues when getting a new PC.

Every five years I build a new PC from high-end components and then need to dig up the notes I made while putting Linux on that new PC. This time even the notes did not really help as motherboard adn graphic card were so new that actual versions of Linux distributions had issues.

While searching the WWW for solutions I decide to write a elaborated versions of my usual short notes on how and what I did to make things run smooth at the end.

As above text reads this was initially setup as guide for people developing hardware but while writing and getting comments from colleagues and friends it turned out that the document (webpages ) are useful for eveybody wanting to install Linux on a brand new custom build PC.

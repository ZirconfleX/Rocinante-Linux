The VirtualBox is now installed and ready for use on your Manjaro system. Reload its modules:

sudo vboxreload

verify the exact version of the installed locally VirtualBox

vboxmanage -v | cut -dr -f1

It is: 7.0.18 in my case

wget https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.18/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-7.0.18.vbox-extpack

install the VirtualBox Extension pack

sudo vboxmanage extpack install Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-7.0.18.vbox-extpack

agree to Oracle’s license terms and conditions, answer YES

verify installed VirtualBox’s extension pack version

vboxmanage list extpacks

Before using VirtualBox, add your user account to the “vboxusers” group.

sudo usermod -aG vboxusers $USER

groups $USER

start using VirtualBox by launching it from the desktop environment’s application menu -> “System” -> “Oracle VM VirtualBox.”

After install of the geust OS, it is best to install VirtualBoxGuestadditions.

Example :
    Configure all settings of VirtualBox for a Guest OS.
    Install as Guest OS, Linux Mint 21.4
    Start the Guest OS.

    Click [Devices] [Insert Guest Addirtions CD Image]
    Probably it will tell there is no GuestAdditions CD image and as to download it. WHen clicking on [Download] probably an error will follow.

Do next to get the Guest Addiions installed

In teh Guest Machine do:
    Start a command terminal
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install build-essential
    sudo apt install module-assistant
    sudo m-a prepare

Go back to the Manjaro host.
    Start a web browser and go to:
    https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox
        Select: 7.0.18 because 7.0.18 is the version of VirtualBox installed  or select the version of Virtual BOx installed on your machine.
        Download the: VBoxGuestAdditions_7.0.18.iso 

Go back to the Virtual Linux-Mint guestmachine
[Devices] [Optical Drives][Chose a disk file ...]
Brose to where the VBoxGuestAdditions_7.0.18.iso is stored.
and insert it in teh virtual CD player.

Aftre a couple of seconds Linux-Mint will pop up a window with text telling an installable software CD is inserted and as to install it. Install it.
Follow the txt on screen (poped up command terminal).

Unoumt the VboxGuest Addirtions CD (Will need force unmount).

Done.
